RFC768 regarding the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) states that the "Lenght" field is
the length in octets of the user datagram including the header and the data.
The size of the data therefore only incorporates the data without the size of the header.
Therefore, the "Length" field should be 8 bytes larger than the size of the data.
