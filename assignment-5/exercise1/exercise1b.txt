To get the most amplification, I'd first need to find a domain with many DNS records. If the domain is example.com and it has subdomains like subdomain1.example.com until subdomain99.example.com, then one DNS request would result into 99 DNS replies based on the amount of DNS records. By using features like EDNS0 and DNSSEC (https://technet.microsoft.com/de-de/security/hh972393.aspx), I would also be able to amplify the attack by a factor above 60. If I wanted to craft such a spoofed DNS request, I had to exchange the MAC address of the source in the ethernet header for the MAC address of the victim. Furthermore, I had to exchange the destination (ip) in the ip header and also had to recalculate the header checksum to make it valid. Next, I had to alter the UDP package. The source port would remain at port 53 (DNS) but I probably had to change the source port because it is different than port 53. At this moment I am not certain how the source port gets chosen. I assume that I also had to alter the UDP checksum after altering the header information. The actual DNS query does not contain any source or destination addresses. I assume that I do not have to alter anything here if the program (dig/drill) already configured everything right through paramter settings. If I had to alter it manually, then I would set the "Recursion desired" flag to 1, query for ANY type and also query all additional records, enable DNSSEC and EDNS0.
