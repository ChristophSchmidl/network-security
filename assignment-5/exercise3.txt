The firewall configuration from assignment 4, exercise 1a allowed all outgoing traffic and only the input traffic which has been established or related, therefore traffic which belongs to a session of any kind. The firewall allows DNS traffic although it's based on a stateless protocol like UDP, because it remembers outgoing UDP packets based on source ip, destination ip, source port and destination port for a while and recognises its responses.
