All the preceding DNS attacks were blind forgeries where the attacker had to guess information like QID, port number and so forth. The attacker had to face a list of entropy measures. A Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack gives the attacker the possibility to read all the traffic and therefore does not have to craft blind forgeries because he can intercept the traffic and therefore also can read information like QID and port number. This makes these countermeasures obsolete.
