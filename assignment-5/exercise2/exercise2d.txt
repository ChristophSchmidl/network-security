By luring the victim to a www.attacker.com website which includes pictures from www.target.com, the attack sees the website request and knows that DNS requests for www.target.com will follow. The main idea is to choose a target with many links on subdomains so man DNS requests will be triggered. The attacker can therefore try his luck with many different forged DNS replies and additionally could try to run a DOS attack against the real DNS server, so he improves his chances of winning the race.
