QID randomization can choose from a 16 bit pool of values which gives 2^{16} = 65536 possibilities to choose from. The chance to guess this value right with one single blind response is therefore 1/65536. If source port randomization is added, then the odds are not that clear, in my opinion. Let's assume the simplest scenario where the source port can be chosen from all 16 bits available which gives 65536 possibilities. Therefore, we would have 16 bits from QID and 16 bits from source port randomization which makes 32 bit entropy or 4294967296 possibilities. The odds are therefore 1/4294967296. But if you consider the fact that the first 1024 ports are registered to well known services and should not be chosen from the pool, where one of those 1024 ports is registered to DNS (53), then we are faced with a reduction of 1023 ports to choose from. This new calculation would be therefore: 65536 (QID) * (65536(source ports) - 1023(well known services)) = 4227923968 possibilities.
