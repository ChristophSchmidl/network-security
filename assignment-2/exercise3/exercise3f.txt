There are two types of conversation which I find interesting: ARP and UDP.

ARP seems interesting to me because there I can see how I had to use ARP spoofing to redirect certain traffic to my computer. The UDP packets are interesting because they contain actual data in ASCII format which I can later on alter to my needs and performing a man-in-the-middle attack by using arp spoofing.
