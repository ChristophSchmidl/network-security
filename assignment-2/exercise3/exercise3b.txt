By using the conversations tab of the statistics option, we get all kinds of conversations between address A and B. If we sort the conversations by the amount of bytes and packets transmitted between the addresses, we can easily see which clients were the most active.

The most active clients are therefore:
	* 00:0f:c9:0c:ee:ed (Allnet_0c:ee:ed)
	* 00:0f:c9:0c:f7:8c (Allnet_0c:f7:8c)
	* 00:0f:c9:0c:f7:93 (Allnet_0c:f7:93)
	* c4:e9:84:d7:70:67 (Tp-LinkT_d7:70:67)

Interesting conversations:
	* Allnet_0c:ee:ed -> Allnet_0c:f7:8c (187.441 packets)
	* Allnet_0c:f7:8c -> Allnet_0c:f7:93 (182.309 packets)
	* Allnet_0c:f7:8c -> Tp-LinkT_d7:70:67 (86.380 packets)
	* Allnet_0c:f7:93 -> Tp-LinkT_d7:70:67 (45.869 packets)
	* Allnet_0c:ee:ed -> Tp-LinkT_d7:70:67 (34.087 packets)
	* Allnet_0c:f7:8c -> Allnet_0c:f7:8c (14.418 packets)
	* Allnet_0c:ee:ed -> Allnet_0c:f7:93 (5.585 packets)
	* Allnet_0c:ee:ed -> Allnet_0c:ee:ed (2.873 packets)

If we open the protocol hierarchy option, then we can see that all frames contain the "IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN" protocol. This protocol is divided into 0.3% "IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN management frame" and 29.3%	"Data" based on the amount of packets. If we look at the pure amount of bytes, then the "IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN management frame" is making 0.1% and the "Data" part is taking up 93.2% of all bytes. One interpretation could be that most of the packets captured do not contain actual data but are responsible for different management tasks of the wireless network traffic like probe requests, acknowledgements and so forth. Also their pure amount of packets is larger than the packets which contain data, they do not take the majority compared to the amount of bytes. So, even the amount of packets containing data is small, they take up the majority of bytes taken.
